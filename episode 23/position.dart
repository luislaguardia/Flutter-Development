// Positional: The position of an argument determines which parameter receives the value

void add(a, b) { // a & b are positional parameters
  print(a + b); // print() is a built-in function that will be explained later
}
 
add(5, 10); // 5 is used as a value for a, because it's the first argument; 10 is used as a value for b
